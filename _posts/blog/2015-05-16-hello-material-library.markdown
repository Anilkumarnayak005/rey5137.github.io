Ever since Google announces Material Design language, I already took a liking to it. And I couldn't wait until the AppCompat team release a new version, so I decided that I should do it myself. I studied all the specifications of Material Design on [Google's site](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) carefully, and tried to bring those features to pre-Lolipop devices as much as possible. Now, Iâ€™m really glad to introduce you to my Material library, a library that provide fully animated material components to Android 2.3+.

##The different between AppCompat library and Material library

Although the AppCompat team did a great work to back-port many useful features like Theming, tint aware widgets, Toolbar, RecyclerView, ..., I still feel that isn't enough. I want the RippleEffect, state animation widgets, materialize dialogs. And that is what Material library supports.

##Why have I name it "Material"?

I always have a hard time to choose a name for something. But this time, it's quite easy to pick up. "Material" is a very clear and short name. It's also easy to understand the purpose.
