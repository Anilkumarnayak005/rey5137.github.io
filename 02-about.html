<p>My name is Rey Pham. I'm currently working as Android developer at <a href="http://epi.com.vn/" style="color:blue">EPI Technologies</a></p>

<p>I love coding. I work on some Open Source projects in my free time. I also like games and photography.</p>

<p>This is my official web site. Most of the posts are about Android, but I also post anything else I find interesting.</p>
